## Test: Obstacle detection and avoidance
### Installation:
```
cd my_catkin_ws
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipa-rwu/araig_simulation/araig_simulation.rosinstall.melodic
rosinstall src/. .araig_simulation.rosinstall.melodic

rosdep install --from-path src/ -i -y -r

catkin_make (or catkin build)

source devel/setup.bash
```
### steps: 
```
export ROBOT=raw3-3
export ROBOT_ENV=mobile-robot-obstacle
roslaunch araig_bringup_sim robot.launch
```
#### for static obstacle:
```
roslaunch araig_objects spawn_object_urdf.launch object:=static_obstacle
```

#### for moving obstacle:
```
rostopic pub /world/floor_to_belt_joint_velocity_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 10.0"
("data" here means speed)
```
## Test:manipulation
# upload targets for grasping 
upload position of static objects
```
roslaunch cob_default_env_config upload_object_locations.launch
```
upload static objects in gazebo
```
rosrun araig_gazebo_tools spawn_object.py milk
```
